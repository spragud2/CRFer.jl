    CRF

A Conditional Random Field (CRF). The struct contains a set of parameters
that can be any number of things. By default, the model contains parameters for k-mers in each
state/domain and transition parameters. 

A CRF with just emission and transition features is essentially a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), except that the model is discriminative (classifier, p(y|x)) rather than
generative p(x,y).

(model::CRF)(x,y,states,kmer_features,transition_features,🐢)

Forward pass of the model and/or negative log-likelihood of the CRF.

Definition the function in this way allows a CRF object to be called as a function.

```julia-repl
> model = CRF(4,4)
> negativeloglikelihood = model(x,y,states,kmer_features,transition_features,🐢)
```


This function calculates the likelihood of a sequence given the current
parameter values. 

This includes the calculation of the partition function for the CRF model, 
i.e. the normalization constant to transform the score into a proper probability. 

The partition function is calculated using the forward algorithm (as in HMMs) in log-space.

This function therefore is the CRF likelihood function, and returns the negative
log-likelihood, such that we can perform gradient descent to optimize the feature function
parameters

🐢 -> L2 regularization scale constant. Sets the degree to which we wish to regularlize the parameters. Probably should not be passed in bayesian model?

    train!(model,input;args)

Takes an input CRF model and performs gradient descent. Updates model parameters in place over
N training epochs. The CRF likelihood function is convex, however a learning rate should be used
to avoid bouncing around the global minimum.

Input needs to be passed as a tuple that includes 

input = (x,y,labels,features...)
